# Genetic Algorithm for Task Optimization

## Introduction

Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. They are commonly used to find solutions to optimization and search problems by mimicking the process of natural evolution.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of tasks, each represented by a pair of values (total time, number of tasks), the goal is to find the optimal arrangement of tasks that minimizes the total time.

## Input
c
The input array is represented as a numpy array

```python
input = np.array([[25, 10],
                  [9, 40],
                  [2, 1],
                  [20, 1],
                  [50, 2],
                  [25, 22],
                  [12, 24],
                  [56, 1],
                  [6, 1],
                  [4, 20],
                  [3, 3]])
```

Where each row represents a task, with the first value being the total time required for the task, and the second value being the number of tasks.

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

The genetic algorithm operates as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Generate an initial population of potential solutions.
2. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the fitness of each solution in the population.
3. **Selection**: Select the most fit individuals to become parents for the next generation.
4. **Crossover**: Create new solutions by combining traits from multiple parent solutions.
5. **Mutation**: Introduce random changes to the new solutions to maintain genetic diversity.
6. **Replacement**: Replace the old population with the new generation.
7. **Termination**: Repeat steps 2-6 until the termination condition is met (e.g., maximum number of generations reached).

## Output

The output of the genetic algorithm will be the arrangement of tasks that minimizes the total time.

## Conclusion

Genetic algorithms provide a powerful and flexible approach to optimization problems. By mimicking the principles of natural selection, they can efficiently search through large solution spaces to find near-optimal solutions. In the context of task optimization, genetic algorithms can help find the most efficient arrangement of tasks, leading to improved productivity and resource utilization.
